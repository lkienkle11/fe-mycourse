# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **fe-mycourse** (xx symbols, xx relationships, xx execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## When Debugging

1. `gitnexus_query({query: "<error or symptom>"})` — find execution flows related to the issue
2. `gitnexus_context({name: "<suspect function>"})` — see all callers, callees, and process participation
3. `READ gitnexus://repo/fe-mycourse/process/{processName}` — trace the full execution flow step by step
4. For regressions: `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})` — see what your branch changed

## When Refactoring

- **Renaming**: MUST use `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` first. Review the preview — graph edits are safe, text_search edits need manual review. Then run with `dry_run: false`.
- **Extracting/Splitting**: MUST run `gitnexus_context({name: "target"})` to see all incoming/outgoing refs, then `gitnexus_impact({target: "target", direction: "upstream"})` to find all external callers before moving code.
- After any refactor: run `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "all"})` to verify only expected files changed.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.

## Tools Quick Reference

| Tool | When to use | Command |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `query` | Find code by concept | `gitnexus_query({query: "auth validation"})` |
| `context` | 360-degree view of one symbol | `gitnexus_context({name: "validateUser"})` |
| `impact` | Blast radius before editing | `gitnexus_impact({target: "X", direction: "upstream"})` |
| `detect_changes` | Pre-commit scope check | `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "staged"})` |
| `rename` | Safe multi-file rename | `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` |
| `cypher` | Custom graph queries | `gitnexus_cypher({query: "MATCH ..."})` |

## Impact Risk Levels

| Depth | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| d=1 | WILL BREAK — direct callers/importers | MUST update these |
| d=2 | LIKELY AFFECTED — indirect deps | Should test |
| d=3 | MAY NEED TESTING — transitive | Test if critical path |

## Resources

| Resource | Use for |
|----------|---------|
| `gitnexus://repo/fe-mycourse/context` | Codebase overview, check index freshness |
| `gitnexus://repo/fe-mycourse/clusters` | All functional areas |
| `gitnexus://repo/fe-mycourse/processes` | All execution flows |
| `gitnexus://repo/fe-mycourse/process/{name}` | Step-by-step execution trace |

## Self-Check Before Finishing

Before completing any code modification task, verify:
1. `gitnexus_impact` was run for all modified symbols
2. No HIGH/CRITICAL risk warnings were ignored
3. `gitnexus_detect_changes()` confirms changes match expected scope
4. All d=1 (WILL BREAK) dependents were updated

## Keeping the Index Fresh

After committing code changes, the GitNexus index becomes stale. Re-run analyze to update it:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze
```

If the index previously included embeddings, preserve them by adding `--embeddings`:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze --embeddings
```

To check whether embeddings exist, inspect `.gitnexus/meta.json` — the `stats.embeddings` field shows the count (0 means no embeddings). **Running analyze without `--embeddings` will delete any previously generated embeddings.**

> Claude Code users: A PostToolUse hook handles this automatically after `git commit` and `git merge`.

# RULE BEFORE CODE

## 🚨 Mandatory Pre-Coding Protocol for AI Agents

Before writing **any code**, the AI Agent MUST strictly follow all steps below. Skipping or partially executing any step is NOT allowed.

---

## 0. Mandatory GitNexus Initialization

Before any analysis or exploration:

* The AI Agent **MUST update and reindex the project using GitNexus**.

  ```bash
  gitnexus analyze --force
  ```

* This applies to both:

  * GitNexus MCP
  * GitNexus CLI (fallback if MCP is unavailable)

Failure to execute this step results in **invalid context understanding**.

---

## 1. Mandatory Root-Level Exploration (Without GitNexus)

Before using GitNexus, the agent MUST:

### Step 1: Explore Root Files

* Identify **ALL files at the root of the project**
* Read **ALL root-level files directly**
* DO NOT use GitNexus for this step

### Purpose:

* Understand:

  * Project entry points
  * Configuration files
  * Environment setup
  * Build tools
  * Framework indicators

---

## 1.1 Mandatory Context Recovery

Before proceeding to deeper exploration:

### Step 1.1: Check `.context` Folder

* If a `.context` folder exists in the project root:

  * The AI Agent **MUST read ALL files inside the `.context` folder**
  * This includes ALL nested files if subfolders exist

### Purpose:

* Recover and understand:

  * Previous conversations
  * Historical decisions
  * Prior implementations
  * Constraints and assumptions

### Rules:

* DO NOT skip any file
* DO NOT summarize without reading
* DO NOT proceed to next steps until ALL context is processed

Failure to complete this step results in **loss of historical continuity and invalid reasoning**.

---

## 2. Structured Exploration Using GitNexus

After root-level reading:

### Step 2: Full Folder Exploration (Using GitNexus)

The agent MUST:

* Traverse **ALL folders recursively**, starting from project root
* Include:

  * Parent folders
  * Child folders
  * Nested folders (multi-level depth)

### Exploration Rules:

For EACH folder:

#### Case A: Folder contains ONLY subfolders

* Continue traversing deeper using GitNexus

#### Case B: Folder contains ONLY files

* Randomly select **at least 5 files**
* Read them directly (not summaries)
* Extract purpose and behavior

#### Case C: Folder contains BOTH files and subfolders

1. Traverse ALL subfolders first (apply same rules recursively)
2. After finishing subfolders:

   * Randomly read **5 files** from the current folder (if available)

### Objective:

* Build deep structural and functional understanding of the project

---

## 3. Mandatory Use of GitNexus for Context Understanding

The AI Agent **MUST use GitNexus MCP or CLI** to perform structured queries.

### Required Workflow:

1. Run:

   ```bash
   gitnexus analyze --force
   ```

2. Perform multiple queries to:

   * Understand project requirements
   * Identify architecture patterns
   * Discover dependencies
   * Map relationships between modules
   * Trace data flow
   * Trace logic/control flow

---

## 4. Full Project Understanding is REQUIRED Before Coding

The AI Agent **MUST NOT write any code** until it has a **complete understanding of the project**.

### Required Analysis Scope:

* Entire source codebase
* Folder and module structure

  * `docs/folder-structure.md` (FULL tree + purpose of EVERY folder + subfolder) (if applicable)
* Architecture patterns — read `docs/architecture.md`
* Data flow and logic flow — read `docs/flow.md`
* Screens and pages — read `docs/screens.md`
* APIs and integrations — read `docs/api-using.md` (if applicable)
* Components (if applicable) — read `docs/components.md`
* Routing system (if applicable) — read `docs/router.md`
* Libraries and frameworks used — read `docs/dependencies.md` (if applicable)
* Shared utilities and core logic — read `docs/reusable-assets.md` (if applicable)

Partial understanding is **strictly forbidden**.

---

## 5. Priority: Context Querying BEFORE File Reading

The agent MUST follow this strict order:

### Step-by-step:

1. Use GitNexus to:

   * Build high-level understanding
   * Identify relevant areas

2. THEN:

   * Selectively read files
   * Validate assumptions

❌ Random file reading without context is NOT allowed.

---

## 6. Mandatory Project Documentation

After understanding the project, the AI Agent MUST:

### Read and update the `docs/` folder:

```
docs/
```

The `docs/` folder is the **primary and authoritative** project documentation source. Always use `docs/` as the primary documentation folder.

### Core Documentation Files in `docs/`:

* `architecture.md` → overall system design
* `flow.md` → data flow and control flow
* `screens.md` → application screens and pages
* `deploy.md` → deployment documentation
* `folder-structure.md` → **FULL directory tree + purpose of EVERY folder (including subfolders)** (if applicable)
* `api-using.md` → frontend API usage patterns (if applicable)
* `components.md` → UI/components and responsibilities (if applicable)
* `pages.md` → application pages/views (if applicable)
* `router.md` → routing structure and navigation (if applicable)
* `patterns.md` → coding patterns and conventions used (if applicable)
* `dependencies.md` → key libraries, frameworks, and relationships (if applicable)
* `reusable-assets.md` → all reusable elements (if applicable)
* `modules.md` → module documentation (if applicable)

---

### 🔴 ADDITIONAL REQUIRED FILE (DO NOT MODIFY EXISTING RULES)

The AI Agent MUST additionally maintain the following file inside `docs/`:

* `reusable-assets.md` (if applicable)

---

### 🔴 reusable-assets.md REQUIREMENTS

This file MUST comprehensively aggregate ALL reusable elements across the project, including but not limited to:

* Data types / interfaces / DTOs

* Exact file path  
* Purpose  
* Reusability scope (where/how it can be reused)  
* Dependencies (if any)  

---

### 🔴 REUSABILITY DISCOVERY REQUIREMENT

During project analysis, the AI Agent MUST:

* Actively identify reusable logic across modules
* Detect duplication patterns
* Map shared responsibilities
* Record ALL findings into `docs/reusable-assets.md`

---

### Folder Structure Requirement (IMPORTANT):

* MUST include:

  * ALL folders in the project
  * ALL nested levels
  * Purpose of EACH folder
  * Role in system architecture

---

## 7. Mandatory Use of `docs/` in Future Tasks

For ANY future task (coding, planning, debugging):

### The AI Agent MUST:

1. Check `docs/` first
2. Determine if sufficient information already exists

### If documentation is sufficient:

* ✅ DO NOT repeat analysis
* ✅ Proceed directly to execution

### If documentation is missing or incomplete:

* ❗ Perform full analysis again using:

  * Root exploration
  * `.context` recovery (if exists)
  * GitNexus workflow
  * Deep folder traversal

---

## 8. Mandatory Documentation Synchronization After Code Changes

After completing ANY coding task, the AI Agent MUST:

### Review ALL documentation in `docs/`:

Including:

* `.txt`
* `.doc`, `.docx`
* `.xls`, `.xlsx`
* Any other documentation format

### Required Actions:

* Update outdated content

  * New shared data types are introduced
  * Existing reusable logic is modified or refactored

---

### Objective:

Ensure **100% synchronization** between:

* Codebase
* Documentation (`docs/`)
* System behavior

---

## 9. Subagent-Based Exploration Acceleration

To optimize exploration speed and scalability, the AI Agent SHOULD:

### Use Subagents for Parallel Exploration

* Spawn multiple **subagents** to explore different parts of the project concurrently
* Each subagent is responsible for:

  * A specific folder or module scope
  * Independent traversal and analysis

### Mandatory Rules for Subagents:

Each subagent MUST:

1. Execute GitNexus initialization:

   ```bash
   gitnexus analyze --force
   ```

2. Use **GitNexus MCP or CLI** for:

   * Context retrieval
   * Dependency mapping
   * Code relationship analysis

3. Follow ALL original rules defined in this document:

   * Root-level awareness (if applicable to scope)
   * `.context` awareness (if present in assigned scope)
   * Structured traversal rules (Case A, B, C)
   * Context-first analysis (no blind reading)
   * Deep understanding before conclusions

4. Produce structured findings including:

   * Folder purpose
   * Key files and responsibilities
   * Data flow insights
   * Notable patterns

### Coordination Rules:

* The main agent MUST:

  * Aggregate outputs from all subagents
  * Resolve conflicts or inconsistencies
  * Merge insights into `docs/` documentation

* Subagents MUST NOT:

  * Operate without GitNexus
  * Skip exploration rules
  * Provide shallow summaries

### Objective:

* Achieve **faster full-project comprehension**
* Maintain **strict adherence to analysis quality standards**
* Ensure **complete contextual coverage across large codebases**

---

## 10. Only After Completion → Start Coding

The AI Agent is ONLY allowed to begin coding when:

* ✅ GitNexus analysis completed
* ✅ Root files fully read
* ✅ `.context` fully processed (if exists)
* ✅ Folder traversal completed
* ✅ Full project understanding achieved
* ✅ `docs/` documentation reviewed and up to date
* ✅ Subagent exploration (if used) fully integrated

---

### 🔴 ADDITIONAL EXECUTION RULE

Before writing any new code, the AI Agent MUST:

* Check `docs/reusable-assets.md`
* Determine if existing logic can be reused

If reusable components exist:

* MUST reuse them
* MUST NOT duplicate logic

If new reusable logic is identified:

* MUST extract it into the correct module/folder
* MUST NOT place all utilities into a single shared file
* MUST respect project architecture when organizing shared logic

---

## ❌ Strict Prohibitions

The AI Agent MUST NOT:

* Write code before running `gitnexus analyze --force`
* Skip root file exploration
* Skip `.context` reading (if exists)
* Skip GitNexus usage
* Randomly read files without context
* Work with partial understanding
* Ignore architecture or patterns
* Skip `docs/` documentation
* Ignore existing documentation before starting tasks
* Use subagents without enforcing GitNexus and full protocol compliance

---

## ✅ Summary

Understanding precedes implementation.

* Root files → FIRST
* `.context` recovery → SECOND (if exists)
* GitNexus analysis → THIRD
* Deep exploration → REQUIRED
* Subagent parallelization → RECOMMENDED (with strict compliance)
* `docs/` documentation → MANDATORY reference and update point
* `docs/` reuse → REQUIRED

If the project is not fully understood, **coding is strictly forbidden**.
